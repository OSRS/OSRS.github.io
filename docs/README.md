Documents Index
===============

This repo includes several documents that explain OSRS Open libraries. These are very useful for contributors, to get context that can be very difficult to acquire from just reading code.

Intro to OSRS Open
==================

OSRS Open is an open source organization that develops and hosts open source projects. The OSRS Network is the primary community organization which sponsors OSRS Open projects.
Any organization can contribute to an OSRS Open project, and we always welcome members to the OSRS Open family.
Any organization which is willing to commit to sustained contributions (labor, code, funding, etc.) should also look into joining the [OSRS Network](http://osrs.network)

Getting Started
===============

- Use any of the OSRS Open projects libraries
  - From NuGet for .NET libraries
  - From PIP for Python libraries
  - From Maven for Java libraries
- Clone a repo from a project

Workflow (Building, testing, etc.)
===============

If you want to contribute a code change to this repo, start here.

Design Docs
=================

- Many more under [design/features](design/features/)

The Book of the Runtime is a set of chapters that go in depth into various
interesting aspects of the design of OSRS Open projects.
